This folder contains notebooks to show different parts of **seismiQB** framework:
* [The first Geometry tutorial](01_Geometry_part_1.ipynb) shows how to load data, compute stats and visualize cube-wise maps
* [The second Geometry notebook](01_Geometry_part_2.ipynb) teaches how to convert your SEG-Y into a much faster and efficient storage
* [Horizon tutorial](02_Horizon.ipynb) loads a CHARISMA-based surface, applies different processing methods and computes QC maps
* [Dataset and Augmentations](03_Augmentations.ipynb) combines all of the concepts into one: `Dataset`. This class allows to generate and augment data that can be readily used in model training
* [The last tutorial](05_Synthetic_Generator.ipynb) previews the capabilities of our synthetic generator, which can be leverage for making roughly realistic data for model training
